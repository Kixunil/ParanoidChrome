Paranoid Chrome

The aim of this software is to launch Google Chrome/Chromium Browser with increased privacy settings.
It strips away all environment variables (except DISPLAY), makes temporary home directory in RAM disk, choses random user agent string, disables dangerous features of browser...
It also uses Tor (or other proxy servers).

Many things can be set up with command line arguments. For now, there is no help output. Look at code.
